# 🏆 **Economic Data Analysis: Unemployment and Participation Rates**

This project involves analyzing **Unemployment Rate** and **Participation Rate** data across U.S. states from 2020 to 2024. The goal is to understand the economic shifts, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and visualize how these rates have evolved over time.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
The project focuses on retrieving, cleaning, and graphing **Unemployment Rate** and **Participation Rate** data for all states. By doing so, we gain valuable insights into the labor market dynamics and economic conditions of the United States. Special attention is given to the impact of the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

## 🔧 **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (for data analysis and manipulation)
- **Pandas** (for data cleaning and reformatting)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **Fred API** (for retrieving economic data)

## 📊 **Key Metrics**
- **Unemployment Rate**: Percentage of people in the labor force who are actively seeking but unable to find work.
- **Participation Rate**: Percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively looking for work.

## 📝 **Steps Involved**
1. **Data Retrieval**: Using the **Fred API**, we fetch economic data related to unemployment and participation rates.
2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Reindexing the data by states.
   - Removing duplicates and handling null values.
3. **Data Visualization**: Graphing the unemployment and participation rates using **Matplotlib** to help identify key trends
